# AI Summary Testing

## Test the AI Summary Feature

1. **Create a form** with some fields
2. **Get some responses** by filling the form
3. **Go to Analytics** page for that form
4. **Click "AI Summary"** button

## Expected Behavior

### If Gemini API works:
- Should generate intelligent insights about the form responses
- Provides analysis of response patterns
- Gives recommendations for form optimization

### If Gemini API fails (Fallback):
- Should still provide a useful summary
- Shows basic statistics and insights
- Includes recommendations based on form structure
- Displays note: "Generated using fallback analysis due to AI service unavailability"

## Debugging

Check browser console and server logs for:
- "Making Gemini API request..."
- "API Key exists: true/false"
- "Gemini API response status: XXX"
- Any error messages

## Common Issues

1. **API Key Missing**: Check `.env.local` has `GEMINI_API_KEY`
2. **API Key Invalid**: Verify the Gemini API key is correct
3. **Network Issues**: Check internet connection
4. **Rate Limits**: Gemini API might have usage limits
